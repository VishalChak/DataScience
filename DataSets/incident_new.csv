This is regarding my newly created Corp ID.

I am facing problem to access service now. When I am trying to open servicenow using ""https://vmnprod.service-now.com/navpage.do"", its automatically redirecting me to link ""https://vmnprod.service-now.com/viaess/"".

I am also not able to see ITIL View option in my servicenow and not able to create any ticket.

Please configure my Servicenow using below mirror ID.

We finalized the NewRelic contract for multiplatform application monitoring on 12/31/16.   As per Viacom's requirement for Service-Now integration, please see the attached doc on integration with NewRelic.

Requirements are a new user account provisioned with rest_services role.  The account should have permissions for incidents in assignment groups MWO-L2, MWO-L3, MCS-L2, DBA-L2.

Since the middle of June, I'm not seeing these automated requests from our self-service tool generated tickets with the MWO-L3 team.   Is there any servicenow level logic that is denying ticket creation?


For example, here I see this email was sent to request@onlineops.viacom.com, but no INC ticket was generated.  The last ticket I see with short description ""Portal request for DNS update"" is June.

Im trying to reserve a NY conference room for a reoccurring monthly meeting  1515 38-04 (VC) which sent me an acceptance for my meeting on Wed May 10  at 10AM Pacific called Nick Jr. App Customer Support Monthly.

When I reserve it this message arrives:

Your request was accepted.

Your request was accepted through 4/11/2018.

All times listed are in the following time zone: (UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada)
________________________________
***This room can only be booked by Event Operations*** To reserve a Video Conference please use the link below: https://viaprod.service-now.com/viaess/video_conf_req_form.do
________________________________
Sent by Microsoft Exchange Server 2016


If I click the link it goes to an old instance of Service Now. My question is that after I sign in to SSO and go  to the new instance:  vmnprod.service-now.com<https://vmnprod.service-now.com/>
its not clear to me where I am supposed to go to request VC. Actually Im not even sure if this is needed since when we set up VC at the Burbank Studio, we just use the touchpad to call BlueJeans. Is it the same for NY? Can the email be updated to lead directly to the current procedure?

Any assistance would be appreciated; Ive never had to set up a room for them before and I want to make sure its actually going to work for them.

Hi Service-now team,
I had few questions regarding our requirement of adding MicroStrategy (MSTR) application access to PAC request.

1.       Is it possible to add the application request as a part of PAC request. So when Onboarding/Offboarding request is raised MSTR access can be added as an item.

2.       Is it possible to trigger MSTR services(user creation/removal) from service-now when request is raised.
Please let me know if you need more details.
